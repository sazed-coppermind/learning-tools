## Git with all of my learning journey

This repo contains (will eventually contain), all the investigation I make into technologies in my free time or whenever I make free time.

As such is something that is saved entirely by me and mostly for me (and my bad memory). Sometimes I may thoroughly explain things, and this is targeted at a future self who I know forgot this already.

This is why this repo is named after fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn saga; since everytime something is put into a Coppermind it is shortly thereafter forgotten. But when taken out is as clear as when it was put in.

Nevertheless, since thoroughly explaining things is helpful not only for me but everyone who wants to learn, it was clear that the best place to save all of this was here.

Hope it helps as much as it helps me!
